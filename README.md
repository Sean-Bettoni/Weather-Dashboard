In this application the user can type a cities name in the search box and click the magnifying glass button to search for weather data provided by the openweathermap API. Once searched the results will appear to the right of the search box with information about the date, temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index accompanied by a weather icon for the day (overcast clouds, sunny with clouds ect).
Below the results is a 5-Day forecast prediction on the cities weather displayed on 5 seperate cards with information on the date, temperature, humidity and wind speed with a similar weather icon.

When the user searches for a city their city search history is displayed below the search box with a 'Clear History' button seperating them. This history is saved in the local storage, allowing the user to reload the webpage and retain their search history.
